        <span>William Blake</span> (28 November 1757 â€“ 12 August 1827) was an
        English poet, painter, and printmaker. Largely unrecognised during his
        life, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of the
        poetry and visual art of the Romantic Age. What he called his "prophetic
        works" were said by 20th-century critic Northrop Frye to form "what is in
        proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English
        language".[2] His visual artistry led 21st-century critic Jonathan Jones
        to proclaim him "far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever
        produced".[3] In 2002, Blake was placed at number 38 in the BBC's poll of
        the 100 Greatest Britons.[4] While he lived in London his entire life,
        except for three years spent in Felpham,[5] he produced a diverse and
        symbolically rich collection of works, which embraced the imagination as
        "the body of God"[6] or "human existence itself".[7]

        As Blake was considered mad by contemporaries for his idiosyncratic views,
        he is held in high regard by later critics for his expressiveness and
        creativity, and for the philosophical and mystical undercurrents within
        his work. His paintings and poetry have been characterised as part of the
        Romantic movement and as "Pre-Romantic".[8] In fact, he has been said to
        be "a key early proponent of both Romanticism and Nationalism".[9] A
        committed Christian who was hostile to the Church of England (indeed, to
        almost all forms of organised religion), Blake was influenced by the
        ideals and ambitions of the French and American revolutions.[10][11]
        Though later he rejected many of these political beliefs, he maintained an
        amiable relationship with the political activist Thomas Paine; he was also
        influenced by thinkers such as Emanuel Swedenborg.[12] Despite these known
        influences, the singularity of Blake's work makes him difficult to
        classify. The 19th-century scholar William Michael Rossetti characterised
        him as a "glorious luminary",[13] and "a man not forestalled by
        predecessors, nor to be classed with contemporaries, nor to be replaced by
        known or readily surmisable successors".[14]
